* Sudoku Solver in Z3

This is a Sudoku solver which uses the Z3 SMT solver.

* Usage

** Requirements

Requires working Python 3.10 versions of tkinter and z3.

Both can be installed with pip, tkinter may also need =apt install  python3-tk=.

** Instructions

To run the solver simply execute main.py (Python 3.10+).

Click on the grid to add a number to a cell. 
Use the number keys (0-9) to change the number you'll add.
Alternatively, press the "gen" button to randomly generate a problem.
Press "clear" to clear the problem.
Press "solve" to attempt to solve the grid, if the problem is unsolvable, the grid will flash red.

* Credit and References

The solving implementation is heavily based on the Z3 tutorial found [[https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm][here]].
The UI code is basically a hack based on another [[https://github.com/Pickersgill/CGLtk][simple TK app]] I wrote a few years ago.
